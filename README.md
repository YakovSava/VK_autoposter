### What is it?
This is a autoposter in social network **VK** (for groups)

### Preface
It was a freelance order. If you will use this somewhere, please mention me, I tried :3

### How to use this ~~shit~~ program?
It's simple! Further instructions for two subspecies of this program:

#### Autoposter
It's just easier to use an autoposter than an autoposter with a picture shaper. From you (the autoposter user) it is necessary to file *config.p*" insert the group admin token and the group ID.
<blockquote> The user token can be obtained [here](https://vkhost.github.io/) </blockquote>

#### Autoposter + image creater
In the advanced version of the autoposter, in turn, you are required to also put the user token and the group in */Union/plugins/configuration/tokens.py*

#### Posts
The */Autoposter/Instructions/readme.txt* file already has everything written (in Russian) how it works.
